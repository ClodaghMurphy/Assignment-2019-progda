# Assignment-2019-progda
Assignment 2019 for Programming for Data Analysis module, GMIT.


## 1. Introduction
This assignment investigates the numpy.random package in Python.

1. Explain the overall purpose of the numpy.random package in Python.
1. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
1. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
1. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.


## 1. Instructions for downloading this repository

## 1. How to run the jupyter notebook used to investigate the data set 
Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project. The name, Jupyter, comes from the programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R.<br>
It is an open source web application used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text.<br>
The Jupyter Notebook is a useful tool to learn Python language and also enables sharing of data and images in a very accessible way.<br>
In order to install: On the command line, $ pip install jupyter<br>
After intall, on terminal, type the command: $ jupyter notebook<br>
Jupyter will initialise in the background and your default browser will pop up in a new tab connecting to webserver.<br> http://localhost:8888/tree<br>
The terminal will simultaneously display instructions on how to stop the connection to that webserver in addition to URL details that <br>contain a unique token.<br>
http://localhost:8888/?token=XXXXXYYYYY123456789<br>
Chrome and firefox are the optimal web browsers to use and you may need to copy the url into one of these instead of using the default<br> pop-up.<br>
You are now running the Jupyter server and can use it to open and engage with my repository contents.<br>
